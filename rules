# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Guidelines

1. **Frequent Commits**
   - Make git commits after each significant change to the codebase
   - Each commit should represent a single logical change
   - Keep commits small and focused on a specific task

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages
   - Follow the format: `<type>: <description>`
   - Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat: implement word validation logic`

3. **When to Commit**
   - After implementing a new feature
   - After fixing a bug
   - After refactoring code
   - After writing tests
   - After updating documentation
   - Any time a significant, working change is made

## Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**
   - The `main` branch should always contain stable, production-ready code
   - Direct commits to `main` are prohibited except for hotfixes
   - All development work should occur in feature branches

2. **Feature Branches**
   - Create a new branch for each feature or issue
   - Branch naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>` or `fix/<issue-name>`
   - Example: `feature/word-validation` or `fix/keyboard-input`

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Create a feature branch from `main`
   - Make changes and commits in the feature branch
   - Keep feature branches up to date with `main` by rebasing
   - When feature is complete, rebase on latest `main` before merging!
